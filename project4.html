                        <h3 class="h3 fw-bolder text-gradient">Reflection on e-NABLE Prosthetic Hand Project</h3>
                        
                        <h4 class="h4 fw-bolder" style="color: white;">Exploration of e-NABLE Resources</h4>
                        <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">The journey began with signing up for a e-NABLE account and reviewing resources for the Phoenix Hand V3. I downloaded the UnLimbited Phoenix Hand from the website. The file includes both left and right hand. Me and my teammate Harry only printed the right hand files</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid project-image" style="margin: auto; margin-bottom: 1.5em;" src="assets/prothestic/Screen Shot 2024-03-09 at 20.46.38.png" alt="SketchDragon">

                        <h4 class="h4 fw-bolder" style="color: white;">Printing Process</h4>

                        <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">We downloaded the file and scaled it to be 150% larger. For this project, I used Ideamaker for slicing to later use the Raise3D Printer. The pictures below is screenshot of the slicing process on Ideamaker. Unfortunately, the class run out of Raise3D Printer so we used multiple PrusaMINI Printers instead. I only needed to sliced 1 file for Raise3D but since PrusaMINI is smaller printer, I had to print multiple files in multiple printers.                        </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid project-image" style="margin: auto; margin-bottom: 1.5em;" src="assets/prothestic/Prothestic_IdeaMaker.png" alt="design">

                        <img class="img-fluid project-image" style="margin: auto; margin-bottom: 1.5em;" src="assets/prothestic/Prothestic_Prusa1.png" alt="design">
                                                <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">The printing process took us 1 class to finish because we had to reprint two files. 

                            We then watched both the video and written assembly manuals that both highlighted the diverse approaches to instruction. 
                            The video offered a dynamic view of the assembly, which was beneficial for understanding movement and fit, while written manuals 
                            provided detailed step-by-step guidance. 
                            A challenge we faced was to focus on following the guidance. We really enjoyed the process of assembly and wanted to experiement and figure out 
                            how to assemble the hand more than reading the manuals. So, instead of strictly following the manuals, we observed another finished
                            Prosthetic Hand Project to understand how they did it. As a result, we mistakenly put the wrong knuckles in the fingers as we thought every knuckles 
                            are the same from each other. We then read the manual again that turned out to be really helpful in outlining which knuckle goes to which.
                        </p>

                        <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;"> Major steps that we did to assemble the hand were: putting knuckles inside fingers, put rubber bands to connect the joints, connect fingers and palm, thermoforming the wrist printing (used a heatgun to heat and form the shape), assemble the strings. 
                            We watched the video on how to assemble the string because it's more descriptive </p>

                        <h4 class="h4 fw-bolder" style="color: white;">Result</h4>
                        <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">The result came out to be amazing. We tested that the hand can grab and carry a full water bottle with no difficulty. I also added a small sticker to make our hand more differentiated. Overall, I really liked how the project turned out and this is the first project where I feel like I'm doing something 
                            on the practical side. The product is definitely something can be used and I believe that's what engineering is about. My teammate did an amazing job with the hand assembly and I learned a lot from him. I enjoyed the process of printing and also assembleing with and without the manual. I believe that at the start of the project, assembleing the hand without using manual was a good choice because it pushes us to become
                            critical thinkers, observers, and problem solvers. We only look at manuals when we are stuck and the process of trying to solve the problem ourselves was more valuable.

                        <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">I took a Clay class from the Studio Arts department before and we made a lot of chips and dip ceramic plates.
                            I understand that engineering is not just about science, but also about art. So I was motivated to do something that I did before in my Art class: Using TinkerCAD, I added a chips and dip
                            cup on the prothestic hand printing. This is tailored for social gathering. User and put both the dipping sauce and the chips onto the cup, making it fully functional and convenient. In order to print this addition it is crucial
                            to have support. I'm thinking to do organic support for this specific product.

                        <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">
                            Reflecting on this third project of assembling an E-nable Hand, I've gained not only technical skills but also a deeper appreciation for engineering (design with empathy). The experience of constructing and perfecting a prosthetic hand using 3D printing and thermoforming was filled with challenges that emphasized the need for adaptability and problem-solving.
                            </p>
                            <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">

                            We faced several hurdles, such as adjusting to different 3D printers, which taught us the importance of being flexible and innovative under constraints. The assembly of the hand's fingers and palm required precision and above all patience, ensuring that the prosthetic was both functional and user-friendly.
                              </p>  
                            <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">
                            Harry and I tested the hand's functionality by having it grab and carry a full water bottle effortlessly. To personalize our model, I added a small sticker, making our hand stand out. This project was particularly meaningful as it felt like my first real product into practical engineering. The functionality of the finished product reinforced my belief that the essence of engineering lies in creating useful solutions.
                            </p>


                            <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">
                            My teammate played a pivotal role in the hand assembly, and the collaboration was incredibly enriching. I learned a great deal from his approach, especially during the initial stages where we tackled the assembly without a manual. This strategy encouraged us to rely on our observational skills and ingenuity, fostering a deeper level of engagement and problem-solving. Consulting the manual only when absolutely necessary turned out to be a valuable learning approach, pushing us to explore solutions independently before seeking guidance.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">

                            Overall, this project was not just about building a prosthetic hand but about understanding the real-world applications of our studies.</p>
