<!-- Project 1-->

                    <div class="col-lg-8" style="margin: auto; margin-bottom: 2.5em;">
                        <h3 class="h3 fw-bolder text-gradient">TinkerCAD Project 1: Lunar New Year Dragon 3D Print</h3>
                        
                        <h4 class="h4 fw-bolder" style="color: white;">Conceptualization and Design</h4>
                        <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">The project began with the intention to commemorate the Lunar New Year (2024 Year of Dragon) through a symbolic representation using 3D printing. The choice to include culturally significant elements—such as the dragon for prosperity, the maneki-neko cat for wealth, the pearl for wisdom, and the yellow star representing Vietnam flag—was driven by a desire to capture a multifaceted symbol of hope and celebration. The initial conceptual phase involved sketching the layout and considering how each element would interact within the space, ensuring visibility and aesthetic harmony.</p>

                                <li><strong>Layer Height:</strong> I opted for a 0.2 mm layer height, balancing detail and print time.</li>
                                <li><strong>Infill:</strong> A 15% infill was selected to ensure structural integrity without excessive material use.</li>
                                <img class="img-fluid project-image" style="margin: auto; margin-bottom: 1.5em;" src="assets/ENGR_Dragon6.png" alt="DragonPrusa">

                                <li><strong>Supports:</strong> Initially omitted, resulting in a failed first print due to the dragon's complex overhangs. The second attempt included a brim for added stability, although, in hindsight, a more targeted support strategy or an organic brim could have offered a better solution.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <img class="img-fluid project-image" style="margin: auto; margin-bottom: 1.5em;" src="assets/dragonfail1.png" alt="DragonPrusa">

                        <h4 class="h4 fw-bolder" style="color: white;">Analysis of the Outcome</h4>
                        <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">The final print, while successful on the second attempt, highlighted several areas for optimization. The omission of adequate supports in the initial print underscored the importance of anticipating structural needs based on the design's complexity. The use of a brim, while effective, introduced challenges in post-processing, suggesting that alternative support strategies could yield cleaner results with less effort. During the process of removing the brim, the "2024" text was unfortunately broke off the 3d print due to its small ans thin size</p>

                        <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">Reflecting on the project, I see opportunities for further optimization. For instance, experimenting with different layer heights or infill patterns could enhance the handle's strength-to-weight ratio. Additionally, exploring alternative support strategies might reduce the need for post-processing, streamlining the production of similar items in the future.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="h4 fw-bolder" style="color: white;">Conclusion</h4>
                        <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">The custom headphone handle project was a comprehensive exercise in applying 3D printing technology from conceptualization through to the final print. However, I miscalculated during the designing and sketching process so the 3D print ended up smaller than expected. Scaling will be something I'll improve on. Each step of the process, from sketching to CAD modeling, and from CAM preparation to the final print settings, played a crucial role in achieving a successful outcome. This project not only fulfilled its initial goal but also served as a valuable learning experience, offering insights into how I can enhance my design and printing strategies for future endeavors.</p>
