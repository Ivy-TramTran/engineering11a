                As we reflect on what we've achieved, it's clear that while we have made substantial progress, the journey doesn't end here. The insights gained and the initial prototypes developed have shown great promise for scalability and impact. These outcomes will steer us in our continued efforts to refine and implement effective water filtration solutions, moving us closer to our ultimate goal of significantly improving the quality of life in Cambodia through sustainable and inclusive water solutions. This project has not only been about creating a functional product but also about learning how to integrate empathy into engineering, ensuring that our interventions are welcomed and valued by those they are intended to serve.
