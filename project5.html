                        <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">
                            In the bustling streets of Vietnam, my hometown, and among my engagements in United Nations volunteer projects, I became aware of the water contamination crisisâ€”an issue not unique to Vietnam but prevalent across Southeast Asia, notably in Cambodia. The stark disparity in water accessibility between these regions and the United States, where tap water is readily available, sparked a determination within me to seek solutions.
                            </p>
                            <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">

                            In Cambodia, a significant portion of the population faces challenges related to accessing safe drinking water and sanitation facilities, exacerbated by pollution from inadequate waste management. The integration of cutting-edge water filtration technologies presents a promising avenue to address these challenges effectively. 
                            I'm very glad to have found my two teammates Marco and Leo who all share the same goals and care about this alarming issue. Together, we are determined to give back to not only the community and also the world around us.

                        </h3>

                        <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;"> The cornerstone of modern water filtration includes a multi-stage process. Sedimentation acts as the first barrier, utilizing various grain sizes to mechanically filter out larger particulates. Following this, activated carbon filters play a crucial role in adsorbing bacteria and reducing pollutants through a process of chemical adsorption. Lastly, reverse osmosis leverages a semi-permeable membrane to selectively allow water and certain minerals through, relying on pressure differentials to remove unwanted contaminants effectively. </p>

                        <h4 class="h3 fw-bolder" style="color: white;"> 1. Tourists interested in buying water bottles:
                        </h4>

                        <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">
                            These are tourists looking for unique cultural experiences, who also care about the environment and want to help the communities they visit.
                        </p>
                        <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">
                            During their travels, they explore attractions, dive into cultural experiences, and look for ways to support local sustainability efforts.
                            You'll often find them in airports when they arrive or leave, learning about local challenges such as water scarcity and feeling motivated to help by buying products that support good causes.
                        </p>

                        <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">
                            They get interested when they learn about issues like the water crisis in Cambodia at places where they can buy things, like airports. They like the idea of getting something useful, like a water bottle, while also helping out. Knowing that their purchase helps build water filtration systems in Cambodia really motivates them.
                        </p>    

                        <h4 class="h3 fw-bolder" style="color: white;"> 2. People living in rural areas of Cambodia:</h4>
                        <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">
                            These people live in the countryside of Cambodia where there's often not much access to clean drinking water.

                        </p>
                        <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">
                            Their day-to-day life includes farming, taking care of their homes, and being part of their community. Having clean water is essential for their health and overall life.

                            They are found in the more remote parts of the countryside, far from cities with better water facilities, usually gathering in places like community centers or schools.

                        </p>

                        <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">
                            What makes them interested is the introduction of a water filtration system that everyone in the community can use. It's important that the system is simple and easy for everyone to maintain. Having a reliable source of clean water can greatly improve their lives, reduce sickness, and help the community thrive.

                            We conducted tests on the water filter and the gravity filter models we created using 3D printing, both with and without activated carbon included. Through these tests, we've identified that to prevent bacteria from inhabiting the microscopic crevices inherent in 3D-printed materials, treating the surfaces with resin is necessary. </p>
                            <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">
                                Looking ahead, once we refine our design to meet our standards, we plan to collaborate with a fabrication service like SendCutSend to produce the components from more robust materials, ensuring both durability and safety.                        </p>

                        <h3 class="h3 fw-bolder" style="color: white;">Key Product Features</h3>
                        <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;"> Our product will prioritize the removal of harmful bacteria and pollutants from local water sources. It will be designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that those most in need can benefit from clean water.
                            Success will be quantitatively assessed by the effectiveness of our filtration system in reducing bacterial content in the water and qualitatively by our reach within the affected communities. Our goal is to significantly reduce waterborne diseases by providing a reliable source of clean water.
                            </p>
                            <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">

                            Our testing protocol will involve rigorous field trials, where water samples before and after filtration will be analyzed for bacterial and pollutant levels. Community feedback will also play a critical role in evaluating the system's ease of use and overall acceptance.

                            <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">
                                Throughout the Brainstorming process, our team employed the Feedback Grid & Big Idea Vignettes approach (Design Thinking Toolkit of IBM), brainstorming a wide range of solutions to address the water crisis. The discussion focused on creating sustainable revenue models, like selling water bottles to fund the installation of community water filtration systems in Cambodia.

                            <h4 class="h3 fw-bolder" style="color: white;"> 2: Acoustic Nanotube Technology</h4>
                            <p style="color: white; line-height: 2.0;">
                            Invented by NASA, this technology uses acoustics rather than pressure to direct water through carbon nanotubes, efficiently blocking larger molecules and contaminants. It's less power-intensive than traditional filtration systems and doesn't require filter flushing, offering a scalable solution for widespread application in rural communitiesâ€‹â€‹.
